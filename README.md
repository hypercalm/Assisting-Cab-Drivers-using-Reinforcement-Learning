# Assisting-Cab-Drivers-using-Reinforcement-Learning

Problem Statement
You are hired as a Sr. Machine Learning Er. at SuperCabs, a leading app-based cab provider in a large Indian metro city. In this highly competitive industry, retention of good cab drivers is a crucial business driver, and you believe that a sound RL-based system for assisting cab drivers can potentially retain and attract new cab drivers. 
 
Cab drivers, like most people, are incentivised by a healthy growth in income. The goal of your project is to build an RL-based algorithm which can help cab drivers maximise their profits by improving their decision-making process on the field.
